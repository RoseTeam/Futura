# These parameters set thresholds on obstacle information put into the costmap.
# The "obstacle_range" parameter determines the maximum range sensor reading that
# will result in an obstacle being put into the costmap.
# The "raytrace_range" parameter determines the range to which we will raytrace
# freespace given a sensor reading.
obstacle_range: 2.5
raytrace_range: 3.0

# Footprints : The center of the robot is assumed to be at (0.0, 0.0) and
# both clockwise and counterclockwise specifications are supported.
footprint: [[0.5, 0.5], [0.5, -0.5], [-0.5, -0.5], [-0.5, 0.5]]

# We'll also set the inflation radius for the costmap.
# The inflation radius should be set to the maximum distance
# from obstacles at which a cost should be incurred. For example, setting
# the inflation radius at 0.55 meters means that the robot will treat all
# paths that stay 0.55 meters or more away from obstacles as having equal obstacle cost.
inflation_radius: 0.55
