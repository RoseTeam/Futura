# These parameters set thresholds on obstacle information put into the costmap.
# The "obstacle_range" parameter determines the maximum range sensor reading that
# will result in an obstacle being put into the costmap.
# The "raytrace_range" parameter determines the range to which we will raytrace
# freespace given a sensor reading.

# Footprints : The center of the robot is assumed to be at (0.0, 0.0) and
# both clockwise and counterclockwise specifications are supported.
